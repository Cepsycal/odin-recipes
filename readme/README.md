Post Foundations HTML Course 7/21/2024: From this project, I learned how to use basic html to show a website with text, images, and links. I also learned how to upload my project to github, and how to write commit messages. I also learned to never put index.html in a folder.

Post Foundations CSS Course 7/25/2024: From this project, I learned how to use basic css to manipulate an element's font, color, placement, etc. I also learned about divs & span, the diffrent displays, selectors, and the diffrent ways to list selectors.
