# odin-recipes
Website that shows 3 recipes using basic html. My goal is to come here after each Odin Project course and update this website.

Post Foundations HTML Course: From this project, I learned how to use basic html to show a website with text, images, and links. I also learned how to upload my project to github, and how to write commit messages. I also learned to never put index.html in a folder.
