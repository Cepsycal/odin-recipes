<h1>Burger</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    
    <li>4 burger buns</li>
    <li>4 slices of cheddar</li>
    <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
    <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
    <li>Lettuce Leaves</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
    <li>Mustard</li>
    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
</ul>
<p>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix until just combined; do not overwork the meat.</p>
<p>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent the burgers from puffing up during cooking</p>

<p>Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the patties</p>
<p>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness. Adjust the time for your preferred level of doneness</p>
<p>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty to melt</p>

<p>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster until they are golden brown</p>

<p>Spread a layer of mayonnaise on the bottom half of each toasted bun</p>
<p>Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom bun, followed by a cheese-topped patty</p>
<p>Add slices of tomato, red onion, and pickles</p>
<p>Drizzle ketchup and mustard over the top</p>
<p>Cover with the top half of the bun</p>

<p>Serve the burgers hot with your favorite sides like dries, coleslaw, or a salad</p>

<p>Enjoy your delicious homemade classic beef burger!</p>
