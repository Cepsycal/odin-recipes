        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <h4>Step 1: Prepare the Patties</h4>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix until just combined; do not overwork the meat.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent the burgers from puffing up during cooking</li>
        <h4>Step 2: Cook the Patties</h4>
            <li>Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the patties</li>
            <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness. Adjust the time for your preferred level of doneness</li>
            <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty to melt</li>
        <h4>Step 3: Toast the Buns</h4>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster until they are golden brown</li>
        <h4>Step 4: Assemble the Burgers</h4>
            <li>Spread a layer of mayonnaise on the bottom half of each toasted bun</li>
            <li>Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom bun, followed by a cheese-topped patty</li>
            <li>Add slices of tomato, red onion, and pickles</li>
            <li>Drizzle ketchup and mustard over the top</li>
            <li>Cover with the top half of the bun</li>
        <h4>Step 5: Serving the Burger</h4>
            <li>Serve the burgers hot with your favorite sides like dries, coleslaw, or a salad</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade classic beef burger!</p>
