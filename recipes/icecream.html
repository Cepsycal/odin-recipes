        <h4>Step 1: Mix Ingredients</h4>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Whisk the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
        <h4>Step 2: Chill The Mixture</h4>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to ensure the mixture is very cold. For best results, chill it for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <h4>Step 3: Churn the Ice Cream</h4>
            <li>Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturers instructions. This usually takes about 20-25 minutes, depending on your ice cream maker.</li>
            <li>The ice cream is done when it has thickened to a soft-serve consistency.</li>
        <h4>Step 4: Freeze the Ice Cream</h4>
            <li>Transfer the churned ice cream into an airtight container. Cover the surface with a piece of plastic wrap to prevent ice crystals from forming.</li>
            <li>Freeze for at least 2 hours or until the ice cream is firm.</li>
        <h4>Step 5: Serve</h4>
            <li>Scoop the ice cream into bowls or cones and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Optionally, serve with your favorite toppings such as chocolate syrup, sprinkles, fresh fruit, or nuts.</li>
            <li>For a creamier texture, let the ice cream sit at room temperature for a few minutes before scooping.</li>
            <li>You can customize this basic vanilla ice cream recipe by adding mix-ins like chocolate chips, crushed cookies, or fruit during the last few minutes of churning.</li>
        </ul>
