<ul>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 cup whoile milk</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>In a medium bowl, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Whisk the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved.</p>

<p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to ensure the mixture is very cold. For best results, chill it for 4 hours or overnight.</p>

<p>Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. This usually takes about 20-25 minutes, depending on your ice cream maker.</p>
<p>The ice cream is done when it has thickened to a soft-serve consistency.</p>

<p>Transfer the churned ice cream into an airtight container. Cover the surface with a piece of plastic wrap to prevent ice crystals from forming.</p>
<p>Freeze for at least 2 hours or until the ice cream is firm.</p>

<p>Scoop the ice cream into bowls or cones and enjoy!</p>
<p>Optionally, serve with your favorite toppings such as chocolate syrup, sprinkles, fresh fruit, or nuts.</p>

<p>For a creamier texture, let the ice cream sit at room temperature for a few minutes before scooping.</p>
<p>You can customize this basic vanilla ice cream recipe by adding mix-ins like chocolate chips, crushed cookies, or fruit during the last few minutes of churning.</p>

<p>Enjoy your homemade vanilla ice cream!</p>
