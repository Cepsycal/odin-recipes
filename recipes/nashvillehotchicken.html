    <li>3 tablespoons cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>

<p>In a large bowl, mix the buttermilk and hot sauce.</p>
<p>Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged in the buttermilk mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</p>

<p>In another large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.</p>

<p>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk mixture, letting any excess drip off.</p>
<p>Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, pressing lightly to ensure a good coating. Place the coated chicken on a wire rack and let it sit for about 15 minutes to set the coating.</p>

<p>In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 325째F (165째C).</p>
<p>Carefully add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding.</p>
<p>Fry the chicken for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy. Ensure the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).</p>
<p>Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack to drain any excess oil.</p>

<p>In a small saucepan, heat the lard or vegetable oil over medium heat until melted and hot.</p>
<p>Serve the Nashville Hot Chicken on slices of white bread with dill pickle slices on top.</p>
