                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                <h4>Step 1: Marinate the Chicken</h4>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix the buttermilk and hot sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged in the buttermilk mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
                <h4>Step 2: Prepare the Flour Mixture</h4>
                    <li>In another large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
                <h4>Step 3: Dredge the Chicken</h4>
                    <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk mixture, letting any excess drip off.</li>
                    <li>Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, pressing lightly to ensure a good coating. Place the coated chicken on a wire rack and let it sit for about 15 minutes to set the coating.</li>
                <h4>Step 4: Fry the Chicken</h4>
                    <li>In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 325째F (165째C).</li>
                    <li>Carefully add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding.</li>
                    <li>Fry the chicken for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy. Ensure the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).</li>
                    <li>Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack to drain any excess oil.</li>
                <h4>Step 5: Prepare the Hot Sauce</h4>
                    <li>In a small saucepan, heat the lard or vegetable oil over medium heat until melted and hot.</li>
                    <li>Serve the Nashville Hot Chicken on slices of white bread with dill pickle slices on top.</li>
                </ol>
